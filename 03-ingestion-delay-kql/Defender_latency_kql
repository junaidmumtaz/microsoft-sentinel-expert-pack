// Title: Example of Ingestion delay analysis for Device Events
// Developed by: Junaid Mumtaz
// Version: 1.0

// Define the start and end times for filtering the events.
let startTime = datetime("2025-01-01 00:00:00");
let endTime = datetime("2025-01-30 00:00:00");
// Query the DeviceEvents table for events that occurred within the specified time range.
DeviceEvents
| where Timestamp > startTime and Timestamp < endTime  // Filter events based on the defined time range.
// Add an EventTime column to explicitly represent the event's timestamp.
| extend EventTime = Timestamp
| extend TimeToAzure = _TimeReceived - Timestamp
| extend IngestionTime = ingestion_time() - _TimeReceived
// Calculate the total latency from the event timestamp to its ingestion in Azure.
| extend TotalLatency = ingestion_time() - Timestamp
